							<p>I view personality broadly as any psychological individual differences that may vary both between and within individuals. Beyond the Big Five taxonomy, I am interested in how traits interact at an individual level to form meaningful profile patterns. Further, I am fascinated by intraindividual variation across time and situation, both as a factor of lifespan development, meaningful situations, and informant perceptions.</p>

								<h3 class='tab-content-h3'>Selected Projects</h3>
								<ol>
									<li><span class='name'>The co-development of personality between adoptive and non-adoptive sibling pairs.</span> <a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://rpubs.com/nguyenllpsych/sibs-mpq'>[Report]</a>.</li>
									We compared personality patterns between adoptive and biological siblings from 15 to 32 years old. As expected due to personality maturation, there was a decrease in Aggression and an increase in Control and Harm Avoidance over time.
									In general, biological and same-sex sibling pairs were more similar to one another than adoptive and different-sex pairs. However, siblings do not change in the same way. They diverge in personality development regardless of sex or adoption status.
									We will further explore sibling relationship quality and similarity in their life events as potential moderators of between-sibling similarity in personality over time. 
									This research highlighted the importance of expanding beyond static personality traits to include developmental patterns and using genetically informative designs.

									<li><span class='name'>Four types of change and correlated change in self and informant reports of personality and identity during college years.</span> <a rel='noopener' terger='_blank' href='https://doi.org/10.1111/jopy.12740'>[Journal of Personality]</a>.</li>
									We investigated personality change during college year rigorously using both (1) different forms of change and (2) different informants to report change over time. There was little evidence for mean-level change, but participants showed significant
									individual differences such that rank-ordering and ipsative profiles were much more dynamic than just average score patterns. Interestingly, there was no correlated change between self and other-reports. Closed friends and family members do not share 
									individuals' perception of their own personality trait change.

									<li><span class='name'>Behavior genetics research on personality: Moving beyond traits to examine characteristic adaptations.</span> <a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://doi.org/10.1111/spc3.12628'>[Social and Personality Psychology Compass]</a>.</li>
									Behavior genetic research mainly rely on personality traits, which are broad, decontextualized, and universal, such as the Big Five. Characteristic adaptations are more contextualized than traits, such as goals and life strategies. 
									Our paper discussed: (1) the large amount of behavior genetic findings on personality traits, (2) findings on characteristic adaptations, which are limited in volume but demonstrated promising patterns, 
									and (3) future directions and important limitations to consider in conducting and interpreting behavior genetics research on non-trait personality.

									<li><span class='name'>Personality change and personality as predictor of change in psychotherapy: A longitudinal study in a community mental health clinic.</span> <a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2020.103980'>[Journal of Research in Personality]</a>.</li>
									Research suggests that personality may change due to important life events, such as psychotherapy, and that personality and attitudes may predict treatment progress. We collected longitudinal data in a community mental health clinic. 
									Results showed a positive change in Emotional Stability, Hope, Gratitude, and Motivation during psychotherapy. Further, changes in Emotional Stability predicted treatment progress, and positive changes in general life attitutdes
									(Hope, Gratitude, Quality of Life) more so than therapy-specific attitudes (Motivation, Working Alliance) predicted sympton reduction.

							<p>Psychological measurement aims to devise methods to assess unobserved constructs and validate these methods using an array of psychometric approaches. Although often not a central focus, measurement is at the heart of psychological sciences. I am most interested in latent-variable modeling and assessing the degree to which measures are operating in the same way across different populations and contexts (measurement invariance) and in relation to systematic response biases.</p>
						  
								  <h3 class='tab-content-h3'>Selected Projects</h3>
								  <ol>
									  <li><span class='name'>thirt - An R Package for simulating responses and estimating 
										  eters for the Thurstonian Item Response Theory Model.</span> <a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://github.com/nguyenllpsych/thirt'>[Github]</a> and <a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://psyarxiv.com/qx82g/'>[Master's Thesis]</a>.</li>
									  In high-stakes settings such as hiring and promotion, personality measures are often used to aid decision making. However, traditional Likert-scale measures are prone to response bias or "faking good". 
									  Forced-choice questionnaires alleviate this bias by forcing participants to rank multiple options that are potentially equally as desirable. These measures, however, present an analytic problem because rank scores are ipsative and cannot be compared between-people.
									  The Thurstonian Item Response Theory model is a solution. This R package uses a random-walk Metropolis Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Users are able to simulate responses and estimate parameters for scoring purposes. We further compare the solution and performance with other available softwares.
									  
									  <li><span class='name'>Model-X Knockoff for variable selection: A simulation study and applications in genome-wide association studies.</span> <a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://github.com/nguyenllpsych/8053-knockoff/blob/a475cb59c55a77362ebbdc9b2e0c9b8b4f2a12e2/Final_Report.pdf'>[Report]</a>.</li>
									  Model-X Knockoff is a variable selection method designed to control the false discovery rate. We conducted simulation studies to examine the robustness of this method and compare its performance with other standard methods under both moderate (n > p) and high-dimensional (n << p) settings.
								          We applied the method to analyze high-dimensional genetic data using single-nucleotide polymorphisms to predict height. The results showed that knockoff is a powerful variable selection tool that works under various conditions where the traditional methods fail.
									  However, there is significance computation cost associated with constructing knockoff variables compared to other methods.
									  
									  <li><span class='name'>A deep dive into the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure: Psychometric properties and factor structures across large ethnically diverse samples.</span></li>
								          Ethnic identity refers to people's sense of self in regard to their ethnic group. The predominant measure for ethnic identity is the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure. Although the construct is inherently cultural, there hasn't been a comprehensive review of the measure in an ethnically diverse sample. 
									  We conduct a thorough psychometric review of the measure and examine the robustness of these properties using a large diverse sample. This includes: (1) basic psychmetric properties such as scale reliability, mean-level scores, and subscale intercorrelation;
									  (2) convergent and divergent validity with other measures of identity development and well-being; (3) measurement invariance tests across ethnic groups with a focus on effect sizes and confirming the latent factor structure. 
									  
									  <li><span class='name'>Differential response patterns to personality measures in first and second languages: Cultural frame switching and cultural accommodation.</span></li>
									  Research on the effect of cultural cues, such as language, on response patterns to personality measures of bilingual speakers has produced contradictory results. We included bilingual speakers from four different language pairs and examined  
									  whether differences in personality scores between the languages would align with differences in social desirability ratings of those personality traits in their two associated cultures. We found contradictory and weak support for the phenomenon of cultural frame switching or accommodation. 
								          Secondly, we looked at aggregated data across all specific languages to examine first-versus-second-language effects. Fluent participants reported more positive personality profiles compared to those with lower reported language proficiency.
